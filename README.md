# Smart4Viation Interview Task.
https://www.smart4aviation.aero/career-tasks/java-web-developer.pdf

The task is not solved perfectly. 
It lacks unit tests. 
Data could be loaded directly from JSON file. 
Arrays should have better bindings.
The code itself should be much better optimized. 
But this is my first contact with Spring freamwork and this kind of tasks. 
Therefore, I will definitely return to the task when I get to know this freamwork better
